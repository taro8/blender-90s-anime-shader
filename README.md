![90s anime render (sanitized assets)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11538692/150199895-86316962-b845-4aad-a0c0-ba34cee8c966.jpg)

Here is a sanitized version of my 90s anime render setup. I removed the assets that were not meant for redistribution, but all the meat of the setup is untouched: the compositing and materials. Also included the grass, trees, birds and skydome.

All of the magic is in the groups, so make sure to look what's inside them. I added comments for easier navigation.

Feel free to use the stuff I made, but do drop me a credit if you do so.
